When this happens, the posts are not appearing in our mod queue for approval, and therefor we are not able to see or review them. 

This is not due to any changes to settings that we have control over as the mod team, and is not the result of manual moderation actions taken by the team. As far as we can discern there is no rhyme or reason to which posts are being affected by this issue, so it does not have to do with the content of the post itself, or any attribute of the poster. We believe this is simply a technical error. 

We are in contact with the site admins to address the problem and return the filters, automod and other automated protections to normal operation. Please be patient as we work to solve this issue. 

#Post not showing up? What you can do:

If you are unsure whether or not your post has been affected by this issue, check to see if a removal flair has been assigned to the post. 

All posts that are removed by the moderators are assigned a removal flair, and normally an accompanying removal message will be stickied in the post. 

If your post has been removed and no removal flair has been assigned, it was removed by automated actions that may be a result of this issue. 

If your post breaks no rules, has been removed, and is not flaired with a removal reason— please message the mods with the link to your post, so we can investigate. If your post has been affected by this issue, we will manually restore it. We apologize for the inconvenience, this situation is temporary— we will update the community as we learn more.",2022-08-19,4:02:47

I've received some requests to elaborate more on those definitions. That's why I've decided to make a post about it. If you'd have the feelings that there is something missing, feel free to reply at this post. Keep in mind that the numbers provided in this topic **aren't actual case-countings**.

Also please follow the subreddit rules in the comments too.

**Significant milestone:**  
Per country and global.

10, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, the moment there are more cases than subreddit members, 25000, 50000, 100000, 250000, 500000, and 1000000.

**Increasing at an unusual rate:**

This is something I actually wanna receive suggestions about from the community. I'd personally think **>25,0%** per interval of reporting cases per country is a good guideline. But I'm not exactly sure about that, so I'd love to receive opinions about it.",2022-07-13,2:32:53

&#x200B;

**Scenario 1: Self-limiting outbreak**

The outbreak ends quickly once the population at risk becomes immune and heard immunity is reached locally.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 2: All population (Doomsday)**

Infections peak at 60,000 daily cases, the total number of people infected nears 20 million and the epidemic lasts for more than one year. The virus will continue spreading, effectively searching for pockets of high-risk and non-immune communities.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 3: Becoming endemic**

Following the current spike in infections, the disease may settle on a long-term, relatively constant level similar to how smallpox and chickenpox spread before vaccines were rolled out. Under this scenario mass vaccination programmes might be needed to eradicate the disease.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 4: Recurrent large epidemics**

Found this to be a relevant experience. A lot of doctors see things and immediately have to decide how to manage it. They’re using an internal checklist and monkeypox, just isn’t on that internal checklist. They don’t believe you, because you are less qualified than them when you are a patient (even if you are a doctor, this is how the authority system works in hospitals.) and if they do believe you, the CDC deters them from ordering the test.

They will begin testing more, but as of right now, like NPR states; it is abysmal.

>  
>According to the Centers for Disease Control  and local health officials, the patient has a strain of monkeypox most common in west Africa, and it's not believed others who may have come into contact with the patient while traveling are at high risk of catching the infectious disease.

>  
>Monkeypox is a rare and potentially serious disease usually found in central and western Africa that causes flu-like symptoms and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash that can appear similar to chickenpox.  
>  
>**It's most commonly spread between humans through large respiratory droplets, but the CDC does not think it's likely other travelers were infected since masks are required onboard planes and at airports.**  
>  
>The patient is in stable condition at a Dallas hospital, with the strain responsible for the infection having a typical mortality rate of around 1%, according to health officials.  
>  
>CRUCIAL QUOTE  
>  
>""While rare, this case is not a reason for alarm and we do not expect any threats to the general public,"" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said in a statement.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I found a [CDC press release](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0716-confirm-monkeypox.html) about the case, also mentioning the airborne risk:

&#x200B;

>CDC is working with the airline and state and local health officials to contact airline passengers and others who may have been in contact with the patient during two flights: Lagos, Nigeria, to Atlanta on July 8, with arrival on July 9; and Atlanta to Dallas on July 9.  
>  
>**Travelers on these flights were required to wear masks as well as in the U.S. airports due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it’s believed the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on the planes and in the airports is low. Working with airline and state and local health partners, CDC is assessing potential risks to those who may have had close contact with the traveler on the plane and specific settings.**

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** formatting + It seems there was another Monkeypox case in USA in [November 2021 in Maryland](https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Travel-Associated-Monkeypox-virus-infection-confirmed-in-Maryland-resident.aspx). Thanks to u/hautecello for pointing that out!  

This [CDC page](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/outbreak/us-outbreaks.html) shows there were only 2 cases since 2003 - both in 2021. It doesn't have much info this case, but here's an article from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/16/maryland-identifies-monkeypox-case/) \- interestingly, it seems they were already discussing changing the name in November:

&#x200B;

>Symptoms generally appear seven to 14 days after exposure and usually clear up within two to four weeks. The virus can spread through direct contact with skin lesions, body fluids or contaminated materials, as well as large respiratory droplets, which generally requires prolonged face-to-face interaction. **The World Health Organization is in the process of establishing a new name for the virus**.

There is a huge influx of people who feel the need to derail any conversation about how Monkeypox is spreading with nonsensical virtue signaling and false accusations of bigotry. No one is saying Monkeypox is a gay disease. It is impossible for a virus to distinguish between hetero or homosexual people. The fact is, there is a set of behavior that is leading the spread of this virus internationally. That is, unprotected, anonymous sex. Anal sex is especially bad when it comes to spreading diseases. That is why 99% of the infections are in the same community. Pointing this out is NOT homophobia. If people talking about the MSM community spreading a virus offends you, then you should not be on the subreddit dedicated to a virus that is spreading almost entirely through the MSM community.

Obviously, we should not allow homophobia in this sub, but if something is based in fact and observable in reality, it is not homophobia...If refusing to wear a mask or getting the COVID-19 vaccine is irresponsible, selfish, and harmful, then how is unprotected anonymous sex not equally as irresponsible, selfish, and harmful? This is coming from someone that is vaccinated, just saying.

They're obviously testing some women since there *are* a number of confirmed female cases, they're just utterly dwarfed by the male cases. Even if female cases were being undercounted several dozen times over, and they were really, say, 20% of infections (and there's no evidence of that), it would still be very good evidence against airborne transmission. If it was really spreading easily through the air there's really no reason for such a drastic gendered overrepresentation.

I came across this blog post from 2010: [Monkeypox and herd immunity](https://archive.ph/pnszp) written by a biology researcher/professor (who also happened to do an [AMA back in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36mw0z/i_am_david_esteban_researcher_and_professor_of/)). 

What the post describes is something that was already mentioned/discussed on the sub, that those who received the smallpox vaccine are getting older and most of us born after 1980 have naive immune systems for this virus, causing herd immunity to wane, thus a global Monkeypox outbreak could happen.

What I found interesting was the discussion that came after the post, especially regarding a campaign to start giving the smallpox vaccine to everyone again, and how it tracks with what we’ve been seeing with this outbreak. As someone who would prefer our leaders took a more aggressive approach to tracking/stopping spread at the risk of being (or looking like) an overreaction, it’s also interesting to see arguments in these comments about how vaccinating the population when there isn’t an outbreak isn’t cost-effective and will still cause panic. I can’t say I know what the “right” decision would be, as there are good arguments on both sides.

I’ve excerpted the final response from the OP, there are about 20 replies, some of which are really just rehashing discussions we’ve had here. I guess for me this is more about sharing this obscure piece of digital history that’s basically talking about what we’re currently living, and wanted to share for those who might also find it interesting.

> This is in reply to several comments. First, as I mentioned in another reply, the side effects of vaccination include a 1 in 3 million chance of dying. This was pre-AIDS and other recognized contra-indications so if we were to blindly vaccinate the whole population of the US the death rate from vaccination would likely be significantly higher that what we have seen before. With a growing “anti-vax” community, I would think a decision to vaccinate the US population would go over horribly. Keeping an eye on localized outbreaks in the DRC, perhaps vaccinating individuals there (who can safely take the vaccine) may be sufficient to limit dissemination.

> Sarah is right that a disease outbreak in a remote part of the world can fairly easily spread to another part of the globe. However in the case of monkeypox (and smallpox) we have the advantage that vaccination is effective post-exposure, which means that if you get infected you can get vaccinated after, and still be protected (within a limited time frame of course). This was key in eradicating smallpox because you could vaccinate all people who came in contact with a sick individual and even if they were already infected, you could break transmission. We could do the same thing with monkeypox. Most vaccines are not effective post-exposure.

> Another comment said that we could eradicate a mutant monkeypox just like we did smallpox. But thats probably not true. There is a key difference between the life cycles of these viruses and that is the host range. Variola was limited to humans. So you vaccinate all the humans and the disease is gone. Monkeypox is in all kinds of animals so it can go back and forth between humans ans animals. We probably couldnt eradicate it from diverse animal populations.",2022-06-26,0:43:12

A particular example of consequence was during the Siege of Quebec in 1775 between the British military and US forces.

The British sent prostitutes who were infected with smallpox into the American lines. As a result of the bitter winter, which meant that the respiratory transmission of smallpox was exacerbated as droplets were preserved for longer, the Americans suffered horrific losses.

It would result in the annihilation of American forces in that theatre of the war and the death of one of their generals, helping to ensure Canada never fell to the US.

Monkeypox although less lethal will no doubt share these aspects, so when winter comes we might have more of a problem, especially when it comes to airborne Monkeypox.",2022-06-25,7:01:40

After today's figure of seven their cumulative total stands at 304, a doubling of roughly 15 days, which is several days longer than its European counterparts. Without commenting on how their exact epidemic management strategy may be affecting this, the 7-day average has hovered around 10 a day since the start of June, meaning three weeks with no further growth. Long may it continue.

However, what has been less remarked upon is that *per capita* Portugal's case rate has been substantially higher than other nations throughout: for example they've recorded half the total number of cases Spain have, but as a nation that's nearly five times smaller. So whilst Portugal's recent slowdown offers hope that other countries will be able to control their own outbreaks, it's clearly epidemiologically plausible, if not inevitable, that they continue to grow for the time being.",2022-06-21,19:30:14

1. Is there any data or articles that indicate that the surge is not aligned (at least initially) to sexual activity?
2. What is the percentage of positive cases in the gay community? 
3. There is definitely an uptick in the last few days, any indication those align with Pride activities? 

Before I'm downvoted or boo'ed off stage, I want to make it clear I'm not out to target a population.  Quite the opposite. I understand the stigma & history of making a disease based on a sexuality.

Most cases do not have a reference on the google docs spreadsheet, and so we have no ability to verify the data. We just have no idea where the case numbers are being sourced from and no ability to verify their veracity. So how could global.health even be sure they have the right data themselves?

Global.health is the source of the graphs and figures we are seeing on reddit and Twitter and elsewhere. This is so so important. Even “Our world in data” relies upon global.health data.

Both model were developed using data from 17 May until 2 June. Now it is time to see how they fare.

But first we shall talk about the source of the data.  I have chosen [www.monkeypoxmeter.com](http://www.monkeypoxmeter.com) as my source.

​ The data are as follows

So here is the comparison with the predictions

Next we take the 7 days moving average of the cumulative data

So how did model 3 and model 4 go in predicting the cumulative cases? Badly. It turns out that the virus slowed down after 2 June and did not infect new people as fast as it did before.

&#x200B;

Based on the 7d MA, we can recreate the daily cases (smoothing out the weekly variances)

What if this was a completely novel virus or one of the group of viruses that we don't know a lot about like nipah.
This has to be a wake up call it may not be as huge as covid but with covid weakening people's immune system the next big one is going to arrive it's not even if it's going to happen but when at this point we have got to fund viral surveillance networks like we do militaries we have to prepare to contain viruses educate people on epidemiology.
normalize face mask post-covid as I generally think mandatory face mask during flu season and winter would be beneficial.
And putting as much funding as we can into research into viruses we know about but we know nothing about and creating vaccines for them even if they do not pose a direct threat if we can do this we can prevent millions of deaths.

Current monkeypox facts,8,vd7is2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monkeypox/comments/vd7is2/current_monkeypox_facts/,9,1655334915,"I wanted to have a discussion about current known facts about the recent outbreak and what they could mean. Sorry, unlike almost every other post here today, I don't have any graphs.

1 - Monkeypox is infecting men in the vast majority of cases

This for me indicates that aerosol and airborne transmission is negligible. I still wouldn't just talk face to face with an infected person, but in general this seems to be spreading mostly on surfaces (fomite).

On the flip side, this effect could be exaggerated by is simply _looking_ for it more often in men than in women as well, but that wouldn't be a large enough factor to change the demographic breakdown largely.

This does not necessarily mean that men having sex with men (MSM) is the main mode of transmission. Lesions around the genitals or butt could leave surface contamination in the men's restroom for example, still leading to primarily only men being infected.

2 - Monkeypox is confirmed or suspected in 51 countries

This to me gives credibility to a stance that this virus in fact *isn't* as hard to spread as experts were saying. It's also pretty unlikely to have spread that far only by MSM. It could also just mean it's been spreading for awhile undetected.

This clearly isn't spread anywhere near as easily as covid, but it's spreading. The amount of cases added each day on average continues to grow as well, which is never good with any disease.

3 - No one has died outside of endemic areas

Too early to say for sure, but still a good sign. Symptoms are also generally milder then expected so far. We don't have much info about how this will affect young kids though, which is the group expected to have the most severe prognosis. To me it seems that the disease is milder but spreads easier, but more time is needed to say for sure

I got too lazy to continue. Would love to hear everyone's opinion on these facts and what conclusions you can draw from them (or any other facts about mpx).",2022-06-16,7:15:15

Sorry I haven’t posted as frequently as before, but there’s not much new to report and I didn’t want to spam this sub with low quality posts. 

I’m no longer on the percocets (YAY!) as the mouth pain is much better. Just taking naproxen now to deal with occasional pain. I have also been using an over the counter mouth rinse formulated for oral wounds. That provides relief and I believe helps keep the lesion a bit more clean. 

My partner had additional weird looking rashes on his elbows. We sent pictures to the infectious diseases doctor and she said it did not appear related to Monkeypox, although it could be a histamine response similar to hives. The rash is subsiding now without turning into lesions. 

That’s about it. Chin lesion is healing nicely too and we are told we can rejoin normal life while we still have scabs (as long as it’s fully scabbed over) just no close contact until they have completely fallen off naturally. 

This will probably be my last post on this unless something takes a turn for the worse. I’ve had so many kind comments thanking me for sharing my experience and how it had helped a lot of people. This is exactly what I set out to do so I’m really happy to hear it has helped in even a small way. Also thank you again to everyone for the support and encouragement.

Remember when banning flights to China was called racist? Remember when politicians encouraged people to go to Chinatown to not be intolerant and coronavirus was downplayed until it was too late?

Politics should be left out of epidemiology, it is not ""intolerant"" or ""racist"" to mitigate the risk of the spread of a virus by temporarily limiting contact with the affected demographic(s). Just as it is not homophobic to question if we should continue with this months pride festivals or to focus on contact tracing and precautions in the MSM community (which are 90% of the current cases). So what is with the name calling of ""homophobia"" when others question if we still hold these events as if nothing is going on in the community? This is not political, this is simply how epidemiology has always worked. Certain groups are at risk for spreading and you temporarily target them to prevent spread into broader populations.

I did this to try and help others recognize what might be early symptoms and keep others safe, and I didn’t realize how much it has helped and also the outpouring of support we would receive. It’s tough making yourself vulnerable on the internet but I’m really glad I did because it seems people are finding it useful, so that makes me really happy. Thank you everyone. You are making our isolation at home feel a lot less lonely. ❤️

Just got a call from the nurse assigned to deal with our case. The results returned positive for both of us for monkey pox. We are told it is a “presumptive positive” and they are sending our samples to our national level 4 infectious diseases lab in Winnipeg (Canada) for confirmation. This will take a few more days to come back. We are the 3rd and 4th positive case in our province. 

The nurse said they were pretty sure my partner was going to test positive due to his symptoms, but based on the presentation of my symptoms, they were surprised that I also tested positive.

As for symptoms, my fever is well controlled with Tylenol. The lesions don’t hurt or itch anymore except the one under my tongue which is more annoying than anything. Just low energy still. No more pictures to share right now because not much change.

Now without further ado, a kind soul just dropped us off some Dairy Queen blizzards at our door that I can’t wait to devour 😊😊

Edit 2: u/A_Dragon brought up a really great question that I forgot to mention: what to do about linens, towels, clothing etc. It is possible to not catch it living in the same household with someone if you are extra cautious. For us this isn’t so much of an issue but the nurse did still recommend to change our bed sheets and towels often. As for our clothing and whether they can transmit for a period of time after this is over (because they may have fluids with virus on it) that’s a really good question that I will ask next time I talk to the nurse. I think it’ll be good practice to make sure we wash all our clothes that we wore before our pox fully healed before wearing them out in public. I don’t know how long the virus can persist on surfaces outside of the body.",2022-06-09,7:28:35

**Key Takeaways:** 

**--In the USA, suspected samples (specimens) need to be sent to one of only 74 labs across the country to be processed before they are then sent to the CDC for further analysis.** 

The process at the moment for clinicians appears to be: Suspected Case --> Contact state health department --> send swab via Lab Response Network --> sample is then sent to CDC for confirmation. 

Any positive orthopoxvirus sample is currently being assumed positive for monkeypox. 

If positive, care is provided as needed, with contact tracing / vaccination where appropriate also following. 

Concerns are that this may delay timely detection of any positive cases. Sorting out sample logistics/lab logistics was a big issue at the start of COVID-19 as well, so it is interesting that we're seeing the same early sample processing concerns again. 

**--There are concerns that undertesting is resulting in a potentially significant number of missed cases going undetected.** 

A broader degree of community level spread is suspected, but data is lacking at time of writing; It is unknown to what extent monkeypox may be spreading undetected at the moment. 

**--Expansion of testing and sample processing is needed to improve detection capabilities in general.** 

**--Symptomatic expression (the symptoms people are developing) are notably deviating from the ""classical"" presentations of the illness as noted in prior outbreaks.** 

Of particular note, lesions are remaining localised or few lesions are developing in total, and some individuals have presented with rash prior to developing systemic symptoms (such as fever). 

This was also noted to some degree previously in [a few case studies carried out in the UK](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00228-6/fulltext#.Yo1dNYaEDuw.twitter) prior to the current outbreak, in which symptoms varied more than expected. 

In prior outbreaks, it was more common for fever and fatigue to be an early symptom, and lesions were more commonly distributed across the body in larger total number. 

Due to many cases presenting as relatively mild or atypically symptomatic, it may be the case that many cases are not being identified. (It has already been noted previously that monkeypox lesions in the genital area may be easily mistaken for syphilis, herpes, or other illnesses-- At least at first.) 

**--Community health services (this seems to include sexual health clinics) are not all forthcoming in providing monkeypox testing or screening, and several patients have stated further self-advocacy was needed to obtain the necessary testing.**

\--

**TL;DR:** 

\-Lab capacity and time of sample processing is of concern 

\-Broader testing is needed, coupled with expanded sample processing services 

\-Degree of potential community level spread needs to be assessed as much as possible

\-There may be some difficulty in obtaining a test or successfully being screened, even if a patient presents with what may be monkeypox symptoms 

\-There seems to be some variation in how monkeypox symptoms are presenting, both in terms of overall severity as well as in regards to which symptoms are appearing at various stages of illness 

\--

I hope the above is interesting to someone; These are all very good points to highlight, and as always, more data will become available as research is carried out while the outbreak continues to develop.

I have relatively minor symptoms and my partner has slightly worse than me, but certainly different presentations than what we were expecting based on what we have read on the CDC website.

https://preview.redd.it/8lxi1aq9v8491.jpg?width=3015&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88c6b813e09e1f84928f4e098e9b09deec282fc0

Today I woke up with what appears to be two new lesions on my chin. I wanted to post what these look like to help others possibly identify what they could look like. The pictures online do not resemble what I have, and these easily could be mistaken for pimples or whiteheads. The difference is that I accidentally scratched one and as you can see in the pic, there is a yellow crust that formed from what came out. This is different from a whitehead pimple where the whitehead will spill out and disappear and not come back for a while. When I scratched the lesion, it crusted over very quickly and filled up again with the white/yellow substance in about an hour. It does not hurt at all.

Here's a timeline of events:

May 10 - June 1: partner has close contact with a confirmed case. He also had close contact with a non-confirmed case during this period, and that other person is experiencing similar symptoms to us. My partner and I live together.

June 1: Partner develops fever, muscle/body aches, general malaise.

June 2: Partner starts developing a few localized and painful lesions. Gets STI panel done. All come back negative. No one at the clinic thought to check for monkey pox.

June 3: I start feeling pretty fatigued throughout the whole day, but not enough to knock me out. Went out on this evening with some friends. Partner stayed home. I felt fine the next day.

June 5: Partner recovers mostly from fever/fatigue but had a few more lesions develop in same area and one on his hand. He gets a call from the contact tracing/public health nurse that he had been in close contact with a confirmed case. Nurse asks if I'm having any symptoms too, I just started developing what I thought was a canker sore that morning. I looked in the mirror and it looked bigger than a canker sore and a bit of a different presentation (not flat, split in the middle, on my lingual frenulum). Nurse considers it a lesion and sends us for testing. Considers us both probable cases due to close contact and presentation of symptoms.

June 6: Go to hospital to get tested. They swabbed our lesions and took blood and urine. My only symptoms until this point in time were fatigue and a single lesion under my tongue.

June 7: Woke up, lesion under tongue hurt a bit more/inflamed. Took Advil/Tylenol, which helped with pain. Pain pretty low still, maybe a 2.5/10. Looked in mirror, developed two new suspected monkey pox lesions on chin (pic attached). They do not hurt at all.

The biggest difference between the suspected monkey pox lesions on my chin and pimples, as stated above, is it leaves a yellow crusty residue when I accidentally scratched one. It also filled right back up right away and covered over. The yellow residue almost resembles a yellow crust from impetigo, if you've ever seen that, just on a much smaller scale.

If we didn't get the call from the nurse on Sunday, I would easily have written off the thing under my tongue as a bad canker sore and the things on my chin as zits.

Still waiting for results from our lab tests, so nothing confirmed yet. We are considered probable cases due to close contact with a confirmed case and presentation of symptoms. This is not presenting the same way as you may expect. Neither of us have had a body rash at any time. I didn't get a fever. There are no widespread lesions. Even STI clinic nurses didn't think anything of monkey pox when my partner went in for testing. The same is the case with our friend who is experiencing similar symptoms. Went for STI testing, no one thought about monkey pox at that time for him.

Beware: MPX symptoms in North America may be presenting much differently than what you see in Africa,452,v6j8y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monkeypox/comments/v6j8y9/beware_mpx_symptoms_in_north_america_may_be/,86,1654565826,"Both my partner (27M) and I (40M) have very mild symptoms and I may never have thought it could be Monkeypox until we got a call from a public health nurse that my partner had been identified as a close contact of a confirmed case. I had some fatigue on Friday but not enough to knock me out. Only other symptoms for me are a small lesion under my tongue which I thought was a canker sore at first, and ever so slightly tender lymph nodes under my jaw. 

That’s it. No rash. No fever. Not a single lesion anywhere else on my body. Went to the hospital to get tested today and we are both considered probable cases. Results should be back in 1-3 days. My partner did get a fever and significant fatigue and more lesions than me (one on  the palm of his hand that looked like a tiny blister, and some on his backside). No rash for him either and no widespread lesions. 

If my partner didn’t get that call I would have never thought this was Monkeypox for me. If other cases are presenting this mild in North America, I can easily see how it could be spreading silently. Again, I am not lab confirmed yet, but given my close contact and the appearance of a lesion, I’m deemed to be a probable case right now.

This post isn’t meant to cause fear. I want to get the word out so people recognize that symptoms may not show up exactly as stated on the internet. It is still early days for this outbreak outside of Africa, and there isn’t a lot of info out there as it relates to how this virus is currently presenting. Even the CDC website leads one to believe that the progression of symptoms happens in a specific way and presents the same for everyone. Anecdotally, (sample size=2) this has not been the case for us. 

My hope with this post is to make people aware of this possibility, but not to cause mass panic. If you have symptoms right now or you think you might have symptoms, consider that it may not present exactly as you read online. Try not to freak out. No one in this current outbreak outside of Africa has reported to have died yet from this as of this writing. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Also, many things can be mistaken for a lesion: ingrown hair, pimple, hives, to name a few. You know your body best. Don’t freak out with every small mark you see, but know when to investigate more. The more symptoms you have that match the list of potential symptoms, the more you may want to consider further investigation. But don’t expect to have all the symptoms, because as the title says, it seems this is presenting quite differently and more mildly in some cases.

Just to touch on the MSM spread: my feelings are just because that’s where it started doesn’t mean that’s where it will stay. If we applied the same logic to the early days of COVID, it would only be Chinese people who had to worry. The community it started in is going to have the most amount of cases first. The gay community is very small, even globally. The ones who attend events like circuit parties where this is suspected of first spreading en masse come from all over the world to attend. There is nothing genetically different about gays that make us more susceptible to this than our non-gay friends. This is evidenced best by looking at previous outbreaks both inside Africa and out.

If you don't want to read all that, no worries, I've expanded a bit on my key points below with some additional links and resources. :) 

\---

**1)** **It seems screening guidance may need to be further updated for NHS 111 and other point-of-contact healthcare staff, to prevent mistakenly failing to identify potential monkeypox cases.**

In my original comment/article, I provide a little more context for why it seems the screening guidance may need some fine-tuning; For now, there is no publicly released version of any clinical screening guidelines, so I don't have any specifics to look over to determine what exactly the process is at the moment. 

However, possibly of interest, the UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) has been primarily handling communications and a majority of the publicly released research regarding the outbreak so far, with some related pages having been put up on the UK Government website within the past couple weeks.

**2) Better public health communications are desperately needed, and internal healthcare system protocols, communications, and procedures may need further review and/or better implementation if possible.**

Self-explanatory, but this has been an ongoing issue throughout COVID-19, and we're seeing some early communications flubs which have already confused quite a few people amongst the general population. 

Communicating information effectively remains a big challenge, primarily for external communications with the broader public, however it is important that internal communications (protocol updates or adjustments as needed, healthcare system updates for clinicians, etc.) are also prioritised to avoid confusion or delays. 

\---

**3) Confirmation bias and possibly overly restrictive / outdated guidelines present an overall potential risk both in healthcare and among the general public, in regards to suspecting, identifying, reporting, and referring potential monkeypox cases.**

[I already touched a bit on this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monkeypox/comments/v4m8qu/monkeypox_more_than_half_of_infections_in_the/ib5edoh/?context=3), in regards to the confirmation bias concerns. 

Effective communications and timely updates are going to play a big role in making sure the public as well as healthcare service workers are informed and up to date regarding any symptoms, risks, ways in which people who may be having symptoms of monkeypox can obtain further assistance as needed, procedure for identifying and escalating any suspected/potential monkeypox cases, etc. 

We need to be sure people are aware of what constitutes risky behaviour (transmission risks), can identify any potential symptoms, are not afraid to seek out care, and are able to do so via appropriate initial point of contact healthcare services which will ideally be using up to date screening questions and criteria to help identify any potential cases and address the situation from there as necessary.

**4) In-person healthcare services and remote healthcare services are equally important, and carry different risks. Information around any healthcare system protocols may never be released publicly, at least not in full. However, it is worth paying attention to how patients progress through the healthcare system from point of initial identification onwards.** 

It is also worth thinking about how cases are confirmed, and where there may be logistical or other challenges which may present risk of delays or difficulties in obtaining or confirming results.

\---

**5) Overall strain on the NHS presents a real threat to public health in the UK in general at the moment, and it is yet to be seen how this may ultimately impact any measures taken in regards to monkeypox.**

I covered this more in depth in several other places, but essentially, the continuous overloading of the healthcare system is a serious concern, and it may be pertinent to take actions to identify, assess, and address any issues which may impact on the ability of the NHS to respond to the outbreak. 

There are persistent staffing shortages, supply shortages, ambulance service delays, facility capacity concerns (largely due to COVID-19 on top of typical daily average number of patients for other illnesses or health concerns), backlogged appointments creating delays in accessing primary care resources or services, pharmaceutical supply chain issues causing delays in restocking certain medications, etc. 

Not to mention staff burnout and staff retention problems, which were already compounded by both COVID-19 and Brexit, which resulted in a lot of NHS staff leaving the service or moving to other services; [I wrote a bit about this here](https://medium.com/@meederprofessional/running-out-of-healthcare-workers-make-medical-education-free-eaba6d3ac028) a while back. 

All of these issues accumulate and compound on one another, and the government desperately needs to start allocating appropriate funding and resources to the NHS in order to start effectively addressing some of these concerns.

Many of these concerns (and more) are likely to persist for some time, such as the patient appointment backlog, and it has yet to be seen if the UK Government may be willing to actually start focusing on some of these issues in light of monkeypox and the additional risk it presents to public health.

**6)** **While vaccines are available and ring vaccination is underway, there is a high rate of refusal already being observed in both healthcare workers and close contacts of confirmed infected individuals. This could present a serious risk to early containment of any further transmission.**

**7)** **Jubilee activities may end up playing a role in spreading the virus further, however of course there is no proof of this as of yet, and it may be some time before we notice any symptomatic cases that may result from any Jubilee events due to the fairly long pre-symptomatic stage of monkeypox.** 

Lots of big crowds with close contact with hundreds of strangers, most people are taking public transportation via maximum or high capacity buses or trains, lots of food sharing at picnics and other events, due to warm weather many people are wearing short sleeves or no sleeves (so lots of skin to skin casual close contact), and of course, people will be having intimate relations  as well, because it is a Bank Holiday weekend during summer. 

That's not a full list of risks, but needless to say, there is the possibility that some transmission of monkeypox may occur due to Jubilee celebratory events. 

With an incubation period of 7 to 14 days on average, depending on how contagious an infected person may be during that stage of illness, it may be the case that not-yet-recognisably-symptomatic people may be attending events in close proximity to others. 

It may also be the case that some symptoms may not be immediately identified by a person as being possible monkeypox. 

For example, a rash may potentially be interpreted as a lingering sunburn from being outside all weekend, or a fever might be mistaken as part of a brutal hangover post-partying, or the onset of any lesions may be mistaken as an acne outbreak after several days of eating sugary sweets and treats at events. 

Of course, there's no way to tell yet, but it'll be interesting to keep an eye on the statistics, as there will be a delay in catching up on the numbers from the Bank Holiday period, and if any cases do potentially develop following any Jubilee events, it will be several days to potentially a few weeks before any such cases may be identified, confirmed, and counted.

I’ve seen bedding and clothing mentioned as well as individuals with monkeypox requiring their own washroom facilities so that must be a risk also. We really got away from a lot of surface cleaning for COVID when the research began indicating its air born.  Certainly I’m no stranger to hand sanitizer but I am wondering about shared public washrooms and what others might be considering in terms of sanitization (maybe I need to learn how to hover)??",2022-06-05,7:30:15

However, I heard somewhere (forgot the source) that this has been a problem in Nigeria since 2017 and that it is still predominantly a gay/bi disease. (Including a link to Sarah Zhang's article in The Atlantic which has some info.

Anyway, why would this be? Is it possible that male hormones are a factor? That doesn't seem to adequately explain it either, but just brainstorming.

Also, maybe I am mistaken about the fact that monkeypox is still predominantly gay/bi in Nigeria. I can't find the source for that now. Maybe somebody else here has better info.

Transmission: Potential Good News,8,v4nqq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monkeypox/comments/v4nqq0/transmission_potential_good_news/,14,1654345263,">[Massachusetts](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7123e1.htm?s_cid=mm7123e1_w). On May 4, a Massachusetts resident developed an anogenital rash 3 days after returning from international travel. This rash progressed to vesicles and pustules and spread to the face and trunk; the patient sought medical care four times at outpatient clinics during **May 4–12, during which time common causes were ruled out. The patient was hospitalized on May 12 for management of refractory perianal pain from the rash**. Prompted by UKHSA’s announcement regarding the recent monkeypox cases, clinicians notified the MDPH and CDC for testing. On May 17, the patient received a diagnosis of confirmed *Orthopoxvirus* by the Massachusetts LRN laboratory, and CDC confirmed *Monkeypox virus* West African clade the following day. The local hospital infection prevention team, MDPH, and CDC responded to identify contacts and determine exposure risk, facilitate PEP with one of two orthopoxvirus vaccines (ACAM2000†† or JYNNEOS§§), and provide guidance on infection prevention and control. Outbreak case definitions were created ([Table 1](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7123e1.htm?s_cid=mm7123e1_w#T1_down)). Exposure risk assessment tools used during investigation of a 2021 travel-associated monkeypox case in Texas (*8*) were adapted to monitor cases and determine criteria for recommending PEP.

So essentially from May 4 - 12 the patient was not in isolation. Yet we have seen 0 new cases in Massachusetts.

>**New York**. On **May 4, a traveler returning to New York City (NYC) was evaluated for an oral lesion, and a new painful, perianal rash; the patient was tested and treated for a presumed common STI and sent home.** The rash spread, progressing to pustules, and the patient was seen again and treated for a different STI; all testing results were ultimately negative. **On May 19,** after the announcement of the monkeypox case in Massachusetts, a clinician caring for the NYC patient notified the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) about the possibility of monkeypox. The patient received a positive orthopoxvirus test result at the NYC LRN laboratory and continued to isolate at home. NYC DOHMH began identifying contacts, determining exposure risk, and facilitating PEP for at-risk contacts.

So essentially from May 4 - 19 the patient was not in isolation. NYC has a total of 7 new cases as of this writing. They wouldn't say if the cases are related to the first patient, but even if we assume they are, then spreading the disease to 6 new people in 15 days doesn't point to *super easy* transmission. Most certainly not as easy to transmit as the likes of delta-omicron variants of sars-cov-2.",2022-06-04,20:21:03

&#x200B;

>In addition to the broad outreach efforts, we're also focusing efforts to raise awareness within the LGBTQ+ community. Our priority is to help everyone make informed decisions to protect their health and the health of their community, guided by science. Currently, all patients are in recovery or have already recovered and who still have a rash are being advised to stay home and stay away from other people until they're fully recovered. That means when all of the sorts of scabbed over the scabs fall off and new healthy skin has emerged.

[The CDC has also released a report detailing the chronology of US cases and their detection.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7123e1.htm?s_cid=mm7123e1_w) Worth noting that between May 4 and 19, the first NYC case went undiagnosed and likely took no isolation measures... Because nobody had diagnosed the patient with MPXV. So far, for all detected cases, >20 high risk contacts, >100 intermediate risk contacts, >220 low risk contacts have been identified.

>Till date, over 120 PCR orthodox tests have been performed across the country. Of course, this is just a fraction of what's available 67 labs in the laboratory response network across 46 states actually have the collective ability to do over 1000 tests per day. So what we're working on now is to ensure that that testing capacity is used. And we are asking individuals with symptoms as Dr. McQuiston described, to go to their healthcare providers, and we're asking healthcare providers across the country to send more tests in if there's any clinical suspicion for monkeypox. **So we should expect if this is working to see more cases and more test in the coming days**. To date. We've delivered around 1200 vaccines through the work done her team have done and 100 treatment courses to eight jurisdictions. And we have more to offer states as you're also heard from Don.

\^Dr. Panjabi

>But among those \[samples\] that we have been able to sequence, the variant that is found in the majority of us cases linked to the variant that has been reported out of Europe and has been made publicly available by a lot of countries there. **Those cases actually are similar to one of the US imported cases that came in through a traveler from Nigeria last year that came into Maryland in 2021**. So we know it's been circulating since that time, at least. The **other two** monkeypox cases that we uploaded publicly today. They're **similar to the 2021 imported case to Texas last year that came in in a traveler. And while they're similar to each other, their genetic analysis shows that they're not linked to each other**. And in contrast, the ones mapping to Europe are very tightly linked to each other. One of the two cases that we uploaded today one is an A woman who had traveled to West Africa, and the other isn't a man who had traveled to the Middle East and Africa. **It's not clear what all this means, but it's likely that within the last couple of years, there have been at least two different instances where monkey pox virus spilled over to people in Nigeria from the animal that maintains it**, and that that virus likely began to spread through person to person close contact, possibly intimate or sexual contact.

&#x200B;

>I know that there are scientists that are beginning to talk about whether monkey pox could possibly become endemic whether we can contain it, I think we're working very hard to contain it. And then the United States our containment strategy is focused on identifying cases, identifying their contacts and making sure they get vaccine offered to them and that they're all and that cases are being isolated to prevent onward spread. **I think it's too early to know whether monkey pox could become endemic, but I think it's important to keep in mind that monkey pox has been endemic in several countries for decades.** Next question, please.

&#x200B;

>There have also been some cases in the United States that we know are linked to known cases. And then we also have at least one case in the United States that does not have a Travel Link or know how they acquired their infection. **I want to emphasize that this could be happening in other parts of the United States. There could be community level transmission that is happening and that's why we want to really increase our surveillance efforts.**

\^Dr. McQuiston

The exact number of Jynneos doses is available in the strategic national stockpile (SNS) is changing actively as the USG moves doses from Bavarian Nordic storage facilities (-50C storage) to SNS storage (-20C). This temperature increase does reduce vaccine shelf life by two years but there is more than enough vaccine for the current outbreak.

**Exact numbers are, understandably, not disclosed due to national security reasons.** However, the official said they'd be happy to get back with *estimate* numbers for the public in a few days. One can guess how many there must be given aforementioned quote from Dr. Panjabi saying that 1200 doses have *already* been delivered to local jurisdictions. This is contrast to earlier circulating reports of a *total* of 1000 Jynneos doses being available in the SNS. Dr. McQuiston confirmed that this earlier 1000 SNS number now stands outdated.

There were questions regarding vaccine acceptance among contacts of known cases ([especially since UK had low numbers](https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1532452313750814740?s=20&t=qTMm6Vxvrxz6BsUG2Mn4dw)). **Officials did not have numbers available for uptake, but said they could circle back in a few days. Media was deferred to local jurisdictions to get answers on vaccine uptake/acceptance among contacts.**

&#x200B;

>**We're also making further plans for additional access and supplies. Should we need it for other scenarios,** right. So I think Don's exactly right. We're focused on the current scale of the outbreak, and we have concurred that we have sufficient vaccine. **We're not in the business of prediction, but we're in the business of planning**. And I think that our function here is to continue also as the inter-agency and a government to plan for any future scenarios. So that is being taken into account in those conversations as well.

**\^Dr. Panjabi, alluding to contingency plans of expanded vaccine access in the event that the outbreak grows significantly.**

Personal opinion:

This outbreak will definitely grow in the coming days and will be a ""situation"" of sorts. Likely becoming endemic in western nations, spilling over to animal reservoirs making it impossible to eradicate. However it's very unlikely to become a pandemic of the scale of sars-cov-2.

The data is from [global.health](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/globaldothealth/monkeypox/main/latest.csv) which is the original source for the monkeypox site used by Ohanian. I also didn't exclude any data by choosing a start date, but instead used all cases marked as confirmed.

The model is `cumulative cases = a exp(kx) + c` with `x` in days, and the key parameter `k` has a fit of:

          99.73%    95.45%    68.27%    _BEST_    68.27%    95.45%    99.73%
    k:  -0.02620  -0.01647  -0.00800   0.11450  +0.00824  +0.01752  +0.02895

The best fit is 0.11450, and the 2σ confidence interval is 0.09803 to 0.13202. That's a doubling time between 5.3 and 7.0 days, with a **best fit of 6.1 days to double**.

EDIT: There could be an argument made about excluding the first confirmed case, but the time elapsed between the first and second cases is in-line with the fitted doubling rate, so I'm inclined to keep all data.",2022-06-04,3:20:02

I wasn't tested for monkeypox, but was negative for covid (at home test and PCR taken the day symptoms showed up) and flu a/b, so really have NO idea what I had.

>  
>The people infected in these three cases contracted the virus over a surprising geographic range of places — one in Nigeria, one elsewhere in West Africa, and the third in either the Middle East or East Africa. This apparent wide dissemination of a related virus — one that differs from the European outbreak strain — suggests monkeypox outbreaks outside of the countries where the virus is considered endemic may have been smoldering for longer than has been appreciated, Damon acknowledged.  
>  
>“I think that is one very plausible explanation,” she said.  
>  
>**“What we think that this indicates is that there are likely multiple introductions out of Nigeria at points in the recent past, and there are likely additional transmission events occurring globally,” Damon said.**  
>  
>“It does raise the question … are there reservoirs and human infections occurring in a wider area? And I think it’s really a further understanding of the Middle East and East Africa as potential areas where the virus was introduced.”  
>  
>Public health authorities have already raised concerns about whether monkeypox spread can be stopped, with Hans Kluge, the director of the European office of the World Health Organization, acknowledging earlier this week that it is [currently unclear](https://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/statements/2022/statement-monkeypox-in-the-european-region-what-we-know-so-far-and-how-we-need-to-respond) whether the outbreak will be contained.

>**When asked if she thought the spread of monkeypox could be stopped, Damon sidestepped the question.**  
>  
>“Everybody is working really hard to try to understand what’s happening and … to think about what public health tools can be used to prevent additional spread, including sort of looking at the **use of vaccines and the use of therapeutics, which are not unlimited in supply,”** she said. **“I think it is only with the tight surveillance and looking at what is happening will we understand whether this is something that can be contained.”**

First I need a source of data and I have chosen [www.monkeypoxmeter.com](https://www.monkeypoxmeter.com) as my source.

Next I need a date as my day zero. I have chosen the date **2022-May-17** as my **day 0**

So here are the data for the cumulative confirmed cases from monkeypoxmeter

\[10.0, 31.0, 47.0, 93.0, 109.0, 109.0, 171.0, 222.0, 266.0, 348.0, 399.0, 415.0, 429.0, 552.0, 606.0, 700.0, 778.0\]

**Third model**

The third model uses the mathematical model p\[1\] \* exp(p\[2\]\*t) + p\[3\]

Using curve fitting software, I get the following result

exponential model 3 is 275.6665 \* exp(0.0835 \* t) + -273.0315

The the graph of the model vs reality is as below

**More than half of England's confirmed monkeypox cases have occurred in men who are gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, new data shows.**

Of 190 confirmed cases identified by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) from 6 to 31 May, 183 were in England, four were in Scotland, two were in Northern Ireland and one was in Wales.

The findings show, 86% of England's cases are in London residents and only two were women.

Most monkeypox cases have occurred in people aged 20 to 49 years old.

111 cases are males known to be gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, the agency said.

Investigations to date have identified links to gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad, the UKHSA said.

Professor Kevin Fenton, London regional director for public health said: ""Monkeypox can affect anyone but we know that many of the most recent diagnoses are in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, many of whom live in, or have links to London.

&#x200B;

Monkeypox have so far only very rarely left africa and such an outbreak is at least new to me.

So I got some late 2019 flashbacks where our media told not to concern about covid. It ain’t so contagious and there is no need to concern. Then it fucked us for two years straight. 

Now it’s the same, experts told us (in our media) there is no need to concern, monkeypox are not so contagious. 

But to be honest, cases popping all over the world, hundreds a day, don’t feel like ""it’s not so contagious"". 

So maybe some more educated people can help me here. Is it possible, the we are now fighting against a new mutation of Monkeypox wich is much more contagious?

The smallpox carried by one of the African slaves brought over by the Spanish began to spread. It set in like wildfire amongst the Aztecs who had no previous exposure to the disease and unlike the Spaniards had built up no acquired immunity. 

Suddenly, all of the Aztecs young warriors were dying fast, without this the Spanish quickly made gains and reversed the entire outcome of the conflict.

**'Virus could get better at infecting humans, cause bigger outbreaks if unchecked'**  


For years, African scientists tracked a steep rise in monkeypox cases.  
More than 2,800 suspected cases were reported in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone. The year after, there were nearly 3,800.  
By 2020 — half a century after the first human infection was found in the central African country, then known as Zaire — the total tally of suspected annual cases neared 6,300, including 229 deaths.  
The clear spike in infections occurred as globalization increased, humans continued encroaching on animal habitats and cross-protection offered from decades-old smallpox immunization campaigns began to wane. Given that perfect storm, many scientists weren't shocked by the recent emergence of monkeypox in other countries around the world.

**'Our fears are being confirmed'**

 Human monkeypox incidence ""dramatically increased"" in rural Congo in the decades after mass smallpox vaccination ceased, researchers warned in a paper published in 2010 in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  
In Nigeria, more than 500 monkeypox cases have been reported since 2017, including a handful of deaths — and the actual number could be higher, given limited surveillance of the virus's spread in rural areas, said Dr. Oyewale Tomori, a Nigerian virologist.  
""The longer we are away from the smallpox vaccine, the more the likelihood that monkeypox would begin to spread,"" said Tomori, a member of the Global Virome Project leadership board and previous president of the Nigerian Academy of Science.

Nearly all reports say its mostly being found in MSM with lesions mostly in the anogenital region (The advice of a lot of countries is to watch out for spots in this area)

So lets think about this, an infectious gay guy goes to a festival, has sex with someone and passes this on which is why the spots show up on people's genitals, makes sense. However, he is at the festival for lets say 6 hours, probably singing, close talking, kissing other guys too and hugging friends. 

Also gay people don't live in isolation, they travel on transport, live with families, work with straight co-workers. In fact gay people would generally interact with mostly straight people day to day. So why are they not spreading it non-sexually? Shouldn't this be leaking into the straight contacts if its so infectious? Even if not shouldn't it be spreading at least non sexually to other gay people they hug/kiss. 

Assuming a non sexual transmission would have a more typical infection with spots on the face and hands? Seems to me this is something different and (mostly) only spreading with direct skin contact to a lesion (during sex). Perhaps i'm wrong but it's hard to know as a lot of information is not being released.",2022-06-01,1:56:21
